I'm interested in computer architecture, cloud computing (including virtualization and networking) and operating systems (e.g. Linux kernel stack of networking).

I got a bachelor's degree in network engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2017. Then I joined NetEase as a DevOps engineer. In there, I was in charge of the load balance cluster of NetEase Games private cloud, dealing with Nginx and Linux networking.
